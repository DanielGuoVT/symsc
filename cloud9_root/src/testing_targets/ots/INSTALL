How to build (on Linux):

 $ cd ots/test/
 $ sudo apt-get install scons g++ libfreetype6-dev
 $ scons

How to build (on Windows) (experimental):

  1. Download zlib compiled DLL from http://www.zlib.net/ and install them
     following the instruction described in the document.

  2. Install gyp (Generate Your Projects) from http://code.google.com/p/gyp/.
     You will need a subversion client to install gyp.
     See http://code.google.com/p/gyp/source/checkout to install gyp.

  3. Generate MSVS project file.

    $ gyp --depth=. -f msvs ots-standalone.gyp

  4. Open the generated project file (ots-standalone.sln) and build it.
     Make sure that zlib.h and zconf.h are located in a directory found in
     the INCLUDE path list.

  5. Test binary (only idempotent.exe for now) will be located in Default/
     directory.
