To compile uclibc for KLEE:

./configure --with-llvm=<llvm-root-dir>
make

You can also add optional flags by running adding KLEE_CFLAGS=... to
the end of the make line above. In particular, to compile printf,
which is excluded by default, use:

make KLEE_CFLAGS="-DKLEE_SYM_PRINTF"

To compile in optimized mode, add "DODEBUG=n"
